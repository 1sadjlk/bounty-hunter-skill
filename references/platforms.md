# Platform Specific Rules

## GitHub Bounties
- **Search**: `is:open label:bounty`, `is:issue label:"help wanted"`.
- **Engagement**: Comment first. Look for "Help Wanted" and check if someone else is already assigned.
- **Payout**: Usually via OpenCollective, Gitcoin, or direct PayPal.

## Upwork / Freelance
- **Proposal**: Be specific. Quote the job description details to prove you read it.
- **Fixed Price**: Prefer fixed price for simple tasks ($50-$200).
- **Hourly**: Only if the client has a 5-star history and clear specs.

## Bug Bounty (Security)
- **Scopes**: ONLY touch domains listed in the "In Scope" section.
- **Impact**: Focus on High/Critical (RCE, SQLi, Broken Auth).
- **Report**: Quality over quantity. One clear RCE report is worth 100 low-impact XSS reports.

## Crypto/Web3
- **Mainstream Only**: BTC, ETH, SOL (if reputable), USDC/USDT.
- **Red Flags**:
    - "Testnet tokens as reward"
    - "New token launch"
    - "Connect your wallet to our unknown site" (DANGER)
